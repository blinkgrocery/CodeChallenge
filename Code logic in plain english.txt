Import the boto3 library

Define a function named filesearch that takes two parameters: bucket_name (string) and search_substring (string).
    Initialize the S3 client using boto3.
    Create an empty list to store matching file keys.
    Try the following:
        List all objects in the specified S3 bucket using list_objects_v2 method.
        Iterate through each object in the bucket:
            Extract the file key from the object.
            Check if the file is a .txt file by verifying its extension.
            If it's a .txt file:
                Try the following:
                  -  Read the file content using the get_object method.
                  -  Decode the file content from bytes to string using utf-8 encoding.
                  -  Check if the search_substring exists in the file content.
                  -  If the search_substring is found:
                  -      Append the file key to the matching_files list.
                Handle any exceptions that occur during file reading.
    Handle any exceptions that occur during listing objects in the bucket.
    Return the list of matching file keys.

If the script is executed directly (not imported as a module):
    Set the bucket_name and search_substring variables with actual values.
    Call the filesearch function with the specified bucket_name and search_substring.
    If matching files are found:
        Print each matching file key.
    Otherwise, print "No matching files found."
